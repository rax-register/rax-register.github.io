## Scanning and Enumeration

We start with a basic nmap scan to see what ports are open:
        â†’ nmap -A -T4 10.10.10.3

![](/images/lame/3. nmap_2.png "nmap results")

So we have ftp, ssh, and smb open.  Normally it would be worth exploring ftp to see if we can access any files that may contain ssh creds since ssh is open as well.  From what we can tell so far, this appears to be some sort of Debian-based Linux machine.

In this case though we see a Unix Samba version - Samba 3.0.20, so let's try searching for that.
